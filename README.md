The coding style part is worth 20 points. The rubrics for the style requirement is as follows:

- Insufficient or no comments: -1 point (-2 max)
- Code not indented correctly: -1 point (-2 max)
- Redundant code: -1 point (-2 max)
- Overly complicated code: -1 point (-2 max)

### `make check`

In your `Makefile`, I have added support for `make check` which helps give you friendly suggestions.

Feel free to ignore them, however I find that these suggestions help simplify and clarify my code, so I suggest you run this as you are developing as well.

## Submission

Submit your **BigInt.h** file at the following link:

The autograder compiles and tests your programs using the testcases listed in **testcases.txt**. You can find the expected output for each case in this file.
